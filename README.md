**TTO NanoVNA Saver software for the Corn Stalk Integration Device** 

Using source code from https://github.com/NanoVNA-Saver/nanovna-saver.git, the NanoVNA Saver is a multifunctional tool that will provide impedance measurements on materials placed between probes. 
The functionality of the program will be as follows: 
- Read and display NanoVNA data via Raspi usb port
- Analyze the data with determined criteria to track significant changes which represent the presence of material
- Report the results of the data analysis providing the evaluation of the scan
- Integrate features with the Corn Stalk GUI application and add evaluation data to GUI display, giving each data point unique impedance and GPS attributes
